# Graph algorithms
## 1.
For a randomly generated undirected input graph (the input graph is a text file in such a way that any
graph can be entered), examine the time of obtaining information about the existence of edges
between a pair of random vertices, for each of the graph representations listed above. Perform tests
for all elements randomly selecting individual vertices. Calculate the average search time by adding
up the search times for individual elements and dividing this sum by the number of elements
(number of vertices in the graph - n, saturation of the graph with edges 0.6). Graph t = f (n) for each
representation; on one chart, for each search.

## 2.
For a randomly generated DAG graph (n - vertices and edge saturation factor 0.3), use the
topological order sorting procedure. Chart t = f (n) - time to create the sorted sequence. Justify the
choice of graph representation. Give the advantages and disadvantages of the selected
representation in comparison with the others.
