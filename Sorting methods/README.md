# Sorting algorithms
## 1.
Compare the speed of 4 sorting methods: BS, HS, CS, ShS for the array of
integers randomly generated according to the uniform probability distribution.
Submit a chart t=f(n) where: t - sorting time; n - number of elements of the
sequence. The number of elements must be selected in such a way that
measurements can be taken properly. The results are presented in one chart (at
least 15 measuring points).
2 .Formulate conclusions on the computational complexity of the methods studied
and their relationship with the efficiency of sorting and the memory activities of
each method.

## 2.
For different input types compare the effectiveness of 3 sorting algorithms.
a)QS with middle selected pivot, b) HS and c) MS. Examine the performance for
the following data types of the sequence:
* random (uniform distribution)
* constant value (e.g.equal to 0)
* increasing order (step equal to 1)
* descending order (step equal to 1)
* ascending-descending order (A shape – increase odd numbers - decrease even)
* descending-ascending order (V -shape – decrease odd numbers - increase even)
